We may even have internal \"belly button ids\" that represent the member over the course of their lifetime that differs from what's on their Subscriber ID cards.  This sort of specific enterprise enrichment is not going to be part of the FHIR bundles themselves and would occur as further ETL in your Lakehouse.  \n",
